## About the Collection

This collection consists of personal photographs documenting the period of time from when the 2020 Midwest Derecho struck Cedar Rapids, IA, to when power was finally restored to my home. Included in the collection are images of the devastation, in addition to slice-of-life pictures meant to express what the experience was like. As a resident of Iowa, I felt like we were largely overlooked by the rest of the country in the aftermath of the storm, despite the immense damage and hardships the community experienced. While I was very fortunate to avoid any damage that would render my home unlivable, many others in the area lost their housing due to the storm, while also struggling with limited access to the news, food insecurity, barriers to transportation, and more. My hope is to inspire others who went through this experience to share their stories, as well as increase awareness of this event for those who were previously unaware of it.

## About the Creator

This digital collection was created and curated by Maria Jose Eyzaguirre. Though she spent most of her childhood in Lima Peru, she has resided in Cedar Rapids, IA for over a decade and has grown quite fond of the Midwest as a whole. She has Bachelor's degrees in English and Creative Writing, and is currently working on her Master's in Library and Information Science from the University of Iowa.
